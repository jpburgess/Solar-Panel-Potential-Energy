# Solar Panel Potential Energy

### Selected Topic:

### Reason why we selected the topic:

The reason we selected this topic is to hopefully encourage investors into investing more into solar energy stations and solar technology. We would like to show how location and weather patterns can inform the potential for solar panel electrical generation.

### Description of the data sources:
xtract data from: https://developer.nrel.gov/

### Questions we hope to answer:

### Communication Protocols:



### Machine Learning Model:
We plan on using a linear regression model with weather data as features (solar angle, solar irradiance, temperature, wind) and the target will be the electrical output of the solar panels. We can use this model to predict the potential energy of a given location based on their climate and latitude. SQL Database will be connected to the machine learning model using Python and Pandas.
