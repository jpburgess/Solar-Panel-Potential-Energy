# Solar Panel Potential Energy

### Selected Topic:

### Reason why we selected the topic:

The reason we selected this topic is to hopefully encourage investors into investing more into solar energy stations and solar technology. We would like to show how location and weather patterns can inform the potential for solar panel electrical generation.We propose building a machine learning model that takes solar irradiance, temperature, wind, and solar angle into account to provide an estimate of solar panel generation potential.
