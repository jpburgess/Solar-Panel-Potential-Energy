# Solar Panel Potential Energy

### Selected Topic:

### Reason why we selected the topic:

The reason we selected this topic is to hopefully encourage investors into investing more into solar energy stations and solar technology. We would like to show how location and weather patterns can inform the potential for solar panel electrical generation.We propose building a machine learning model that takes solar irradiance, temperature, wind, and solar angle into account to provide an estimate of solar panel generation potential. Hopefully we could use this model to encourage  state governments to invest in solar power by showing the predicted

### Description of the data sources:
Extract data from: https://developer.nrel.gov/.
Features: Temperature, Wnid, Irradiance, Solar Zenith Angle. Database covering hourly. We can
customize the api attributes based on features we need. Database converted to csv and added 

### Questions we hope to answer:

Can we find a relation between weather patterns and solar power generation to inform state governments of the potential for solar power in their states?

Can we find a relation between weather patterns and solar power generation?

How will state governments benefit from the findings of the relation between weather patterns and solar power generation?

Can the study be used to promote investment in solar power generation facilities?
